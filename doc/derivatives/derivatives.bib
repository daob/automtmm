Survey research practitioners have long commented that respondentsvary in their usage of the scale: Common patterns include using only themiddle of the scale or using the upper or lower end. These differencesin scale usage can impart biases to correlation and regression analyses.To capture scale usage differences, we developed a new model with individualscale and location effects and a discrete outcome variable. We model thejoint distribution of all ratings scale responses rather than specificunivariate conditional distributions as in the ordinal probit model. Weapply our model to a customer satisfaction survey and show that the correlationinferences are much different once proper adjustments are made for thediscreteness of the data and scale usage. We also show that our adjustedor latent ratings scale is more closely related to actual purchase behavior.",

Use of 10-point scales reduced the extreme responses of the Hispanics to the level of non-Hispanics. Extreme responses of non-Hispanics were not affected by the scales.

The statistical problems of identification, estimation and testing of such covariance or correlation structures are discussed.Several different types of covariance structures are considered as special cases of the general model. These include models for sets of congeneric tests, models for confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis, models for estimation of variance and covariance components, regression models with measurement errors, path analysis models, simplex and circumplex models. Many of the different types of covariance structures are illustrated by means of real data."

A common situation occurs when a battery of tests has been administered to samples of examinees from several populations.A very general model is presented, in which any parameter in the factor analysis models (factor loadings, factor variances, factor covariances, and unique variances) for the different groups may be assigned an arbitrary value or constrained to be equal to some other parameter. Given such a specification, the model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method yielding a large samplex 2 of goodness of fit. By computing several solutions under different specifications one can test various hypotheses.The method is capable of dealing with any degree of invariance, from the one extreme, where nothing is invariant, to the other extreme, where everything is invariant. Neither the number of tests nor the number of common factors need to be the same for all groups, but to be at all interesting, it is assumed that there is a common core of tests in each battery that is the same or at least content-wise comparable."

This paper aims to present a new measurement procedure, the letter scale, which avoids many of the problems connected with the response modalities traditionally used in attitudinal research, especially the ordinal categorical scales. This paper analyzes the error composition of the scores obtained with this new measurement procedure. The validity of the procedure is also analyzed and the observed variance is assessed to determine which part of the observed variance is ldquovalidrdquo, which part is random error (attenuating relationships) and which is correlated error (magnifying relationships). Structural equation models will be used to provide estimates of the measurement quality: (i) Reliability, (ii) Construct validity, method effect and residual variance. In addition, this letter scale is evaluated under another different perspective, Information Theory measures are also used to assess the amount of information transmitted. The relative merits of this new measurement procedure as opposed to other common response modalities will be discussed in both cases.",

The first approach is typically used to indicate whether variation in the method causes differences in the response distribution; the second approach evaluates the reliability and validity of different methods. The new approach, suggested in this paper, combines the more attractive features of both methods. The strength of the split-ballot experiment is its use of independent random samples from the same population to provide information about differences in response distributions. This is also possible with the new approach, but this approach provides more detailed information about the reasons for the differences. The MTMM approach provides information about reliability and validity on the basis of repeated observation of the same traits using different methods. This information is also provided by the new design. The difference is that the new approach reduces the need for repeated observations of the same trait. Each sample is provided with a different combination of only two methods and the complete model with all methods is estimated as a multiple-group model. This reduces the burden for respondents and also reduces memory and order effects. Alternative designs and estimation methods are discussed, their efficiency is analyzed, and illustrations are provided.",

In particular, there is scant empirical work on the interplay between nonresponse error and measurement error -- despite the potentially significant implications for data quality as well as techniques used to recruit respondents. In this paper we investigate the connection between these two error sources using data from a survey of University of Maryland alumni. The availability of administrative records for seven items on the survey instrument (donations, membership in the alumni association, and multiple measures of academic performance) make this dataset particularly well-suited for this type of analysis. We evaluate several causal models related to the nonresponse / measurement error nexus. These models predict differential effects for particular subgroups of the population: recent versus older graduates and alumni who demonstrated low versus high academic achievement. "

Various special cases of the procedure include the most commonly used individual differences multidimensional scaling models, the familiar nonmetric multidimensional scaling model, and several other previously undiscussed {variants.The} procedure optimizes the fit of the model directly to the data (not to scalar products determined from the data) by an alternating least squares procedure which is convergent, very quick, and relatively free from local minimum {problems.The} procedure is evaluated via both Monte Carlo and empirical data. It is found to be robust in the face of measurement error, capable of recovering the true underlying configuration in the Monte Carlo situation, and capable of obtaining structures equivalent to those obtained by other less general procedures in the empirical situation.",

Differences in reliability between men and women and between age groups are also assessed. The study is based on 204 and 409 re-interviews from the 1991 Swedish Level of Living Survey and the 1989 Survey of Living Conditions respectively. The results show that the reliability of self-rated health is as good as or even better than that of most of the more specific questions. Only an indicator of high blood pressure showed significantly higher reliability. The reliability of self-rated health is good in all subgroups studied, and is even excellent among older men. It is concluded that the good overall reliability of self-rated health found in this study is in line with previous results concerning the validity of people's assessments of their general health as well as results concerning the basis upon which they make these judgements.",
